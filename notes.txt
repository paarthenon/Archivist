Notes

Intro
  Electron based parser and image scraper. First site TBD.

Ontology
  State
    Task List
      Task def:
        Images found (?) - worth doing?
          - (*) Some sites may require measures that will force definitions to
                do some magic shit with cookie management and referral urls in
                order to successfully download images. Site definitions should
                self-report status a la sharepoint timer jobs
        site.json file with the site name, and preferred entry points

Pages

  Home (add new)
    - Add new parse task
  Progress
    - Displays currently running download tasks
  Definition editor (plugins and such).
    - Begin with site definitions as encoded items, progress into making them
      plugins supported by electron's plugin architecture.

Crazy Ideas
  - Repository management, serve role as mini python web server.
  - Allow for metadata available for each image to be used to determine the file
    name the image is eventually saved to.
